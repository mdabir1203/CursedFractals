Introduction

The Julia set is a mathematical set of complex numbers that has a fractal-like property. This project generates and visualizes the Julia set in the terminal window using the ncurses library for graphics.
Getting Started

To run the program, make sure you have the ncurses library installed on your system.

Clone the repository:

bash

`` git clone https://github.com/yourusername/julia-set-ncurses.git
   
``
Compile the code:

bash
```
run make
``` 
Run the executable:

bash
```
./julia
```
Usage

Upon running the program, you will see the Julia set visualization in the terminal window. You can interact with the visualization using the keyboard controls.
